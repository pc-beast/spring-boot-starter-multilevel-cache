# MultilevelCacheManager for Spring Boot

## Description
MultilevelCacheManager is a Spring Boot starter for implementing a multilevel caching mechanism. It enhances cache performance by leveraging a hierarchy of cache levels and dynamically repopulating higher-level caches from lower-level caches.

## Features
- Multi-level caching
- Automatic repopulation of higher-level caches
- Easy integration with Spring Boot applications

## Installation
To use MultilevelCacheManager in your project, add the following dependency to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.example:multilevelcache:0.1.0'
}
```

## Usage
To configure the MultilevelCacheManager, simply define your cache managers in your Spring Boot configuration:

```java
@Bean
public CacheManager cacheManager() {
    return new MultilevelCacheManager(
        // Define your cache managers here
    );
}
```

Spring's `@Cacheable`, `@CachePut`, etc., annotation can be used to cache the results of a method call.
